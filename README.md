# Announcement Bot

## Overview

The Announcement Bot is a plugin designed for use with the Mautrix framework. It allows users to send announcement messages from one room to multiple other users as 1 to 1 private chat room. This bot is used to send anonymous messages to users similar to server notices but with more custom option.

# Announcement Bot Functionality

1. **Private Room Creation**:
   - An admin can create a private room specifically for sending announcements using the announcement bot.

2. **Sending Announcements**:
   - The admin can send announcements through this private room.
   - The bot will deliver these announcements to users configured as "allowed users" in the bot's configuration file. Each user will receive the messages in their own direct private room.

3. **Updating Room Details**:
   - The admin has the ability to update the private roomâ€™s topic, name, and avatar.
   - Any changes made by the admin will automatically be updated in all users' private rooms that are associated with the bot.

4. **Multiple Rooms**:
   - The admin can create multiple private rooms, each with different topics.
   - The bot will handle the creation of separate rooms for each topic, ensuring that messages are delivered according to the specific topic of each room.
